    <p>Hi. I'm a support specialist at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.<br />
       As a member of the product team at Codecademy, I am helping build out support operations here in New York City. Previously, I was helping grow product support for <a href="http://www.cash.me" target="_blank">Cash</a> at <a href="http://squareup.com" target="_blank">Square</a>.<br />
       You can usually find me at a concert or exploring a new city through its breweries.</p>
